# Narrator

Just a really simple project to allow slash commands in discord in order to narrate roleplay. A stand-in DM of sorts to set the scene between two people. 

# HOW DO

- copy `.env.example` and rename to just `.env`
- fill in the blanks for your guild, token and where you want to post
- `docker-compose up -d`

The bot will run at this point. Whatevers typed into the narrator is put AS the narrator in the specified channel. It's dumb, but simple.
